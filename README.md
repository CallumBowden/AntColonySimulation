# AntColonySimulation
Dissertation Project.

This project is an AntColony Simulation based off the Ant Colony Optimisation Algorithm, where ants search for food and return it to the nest. Pheromones are also layed down when ants are carrying food back to the nest, for other ants to follow.
The nests, food and obstacles will be placed during runtime via user interaction (mouse click).
Each Prototype will include new or improved features and the final version will caontain the working solution with bug fixes and full validation.
Disertation report available on request/When Project is finished.
